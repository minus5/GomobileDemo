# GomobileDemo

This is a simple project made to demonstrate the usage of [Gomobile](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile) on Android.

It was made for the talk at [DroidCon Turin 2017](http://it.droidcon.com/2017/).

Slides of the talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10janQ5UE3hpEIbmRVkoySk5c0rDPPkyYXl98Rb9osuM/edit?usp=sharing), video will be linked to once it's available.
